 A simple FIR digital filter using Verilog and testbench

# FIR Filter Design using Verilog

This project implements a **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter** using Verilog HDL and simulates it using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and **VVP**.

## Overview

A FIR filter is a type of digital filter that responds to input data by applying a set of **fixed coefficients** and outputs a weighted sum. FIR filters are widely used in DSP applications for **signal smoothing**, **noise reduction**, and **frequency shaping**.

This project includes:
- FIR filter Verilog module (`fir_filter.v`)
- Testbench for simulation (`fir_filter_tb.v`)
- Sample input data and output observation
